Number 4:  Date:  Oct 3, 2020 Opened by Grand, closed by: Rocky and Hammer Date: Octobor 4, 2020
Problem:  Palyer::getChoice(int& choice) sets choice to zero if I enter alphabetic characters before digits.
For example, if I enter "xx", choice is set to 0 instead of telling the user it's not a valid choice.
Solution: making an if statement to make sure that the number entered is between 0 and 19, otherwise displaying a "not valid choice" message.
Reopened October 4, 2020.
That doesn't fix the problem.  Did you test your fix?  If the player enters "xy", inText will be "xy", but choice will be zero.
