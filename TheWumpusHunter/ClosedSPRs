Problem:  Palyer::getChoice(int& choice) sets choice to zero if I enter alphabetic characters before digits.
For example, if I enter "xx", choice is set to 0 instead of telling the user it's not a valid choice.
Solution: making an if statement to make sure that the number entered is between 0 and 19, otherwise displaying a "not valid choice" message.

That doesn't fix the problem.  Did you test your fix?  If the player enters "xy", inText will be "xy", but choice will be zero.
solution udpate: adding an if (choice == 0 && inText[0] != '0') statement and a return value of false.
